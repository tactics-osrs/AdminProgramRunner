# PowerShell Script to Run Programs as Administrator

This repository contains a PowerShell script that prompts the user for the path to an executable file and then runs that file as an administrator.

## Script Details

The script does the following:

1. Prompts the user to enter the path to the program they want to run.
2. Checks if the file exists.
3. If the file exists, it tries to run the program as an administrator.
4. If an error occurs while trying to run the program, it catches the error and informs the user.
5. If the file does not exist, it informs the user.

## Usage

To use this script, follow these steps:

1. Open PowerShell.
2. Navigate to the directory where the script is located.
3. Run the script by typing `.\PowerSearch.ps1`.

   *Alternatively you can right click the file and run it directly with powershell.*
